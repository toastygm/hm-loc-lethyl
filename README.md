# HârnWorld Location Module: Lethyl Abbey

Lethyl Abbey is a "Location Module" for the [Foundry VTT](https://www.foundryvtt.com/)
system. This location module is designed to depict the Lethyl abbey in the far north of
the Kingdom of Kaldor, on the island of Hârn in the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/)
fantasy setting; however, this manor could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy
setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

Lethyl is a prosperous, if slightly rustic, Laranian abbey dedicated to Saint Syrele.
It is bordered by the dark Kirsta Forest on the northern border of Fethael Hundred.
It is two and a half leagues from the town of Getha and the Silver Way.
