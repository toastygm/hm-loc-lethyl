Families and mourners enter the graveyard through a large wooden gate that pierces the western side of the cemetery’s enclosure. As a visitor looks left and right, small flower covered mounds mark Peonian graves. Families of the deceased usually plant a small white flower, called boneset, on the grave and the entire area is full of sweet smells and the buzzing of bees. Paths of beaten earth crisscross the Peonian section of the graveyard.</p>\n<p>A wide gravel path leads from the first gate to a second. Inside the second enclosure are the stone mausoleums of the region’s Laranian clans. A visitor walking along the left side path would pass several family memorials. While the larger landowning clans prefer to inter their members at their home manors, many older noble families and all of the yeomanry choose to memorialize their relatives at the Abbey.</p>\n<p>The first mausoleum along the path belongs to the Baralis clan. Wild thorny roses have over grown the old crypt and none but the bees visit here. The names on the walls stretch back to 560TR. Everything looks dusty and neglected but a close inspection of the far left corner will reveal that one of the old markers has been moved (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bdtDRmVGQsY135ma.JournalEntryPage.4AEaz19AwYnBmtQp]{[I8] Male Acolytes' Dormitory}).</p>\n<p>Next, the eagle of the Rynsel clan stands over the doorway of a tall, white burial monument. A weathered marble cenotaph to Saint Freden, the man who held the right of the Serelindian battle line at Noneth, guards the entryway. Its fading carving reminds visitors of the family’s ancient and honorable heritage. A local Laranian saint, St. Freden’s remains lay elsewhere but many pilgrims leave flowers on the memorial to celebrate his memory. The location of St. Freden’s final resting place is one of the questions that Loran the Southron seeks to answer (see @UUID[JournalEntry.lsIPZJR96Q5NKjQN.JournalEntryPage.9KGrhPzZn8nJvQ1e]{[J1] Reading Room}).</p>\n<p>Third in line, this monument once belonged to the Lournay clan but, on their assumption of the lordship of Drilen, was sold to the ancient but impoverished Narador family. The Naradors labor as mercenaries and household knights throughout eastern Hârn. Regardless of where they have lived and fought, the family takes great pride in burying the hearts of their family members here in the family tomb. Jilëa Narador (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bnBWlFJBTpHrgk89.JournalEntryPage.jIN5lCIPcBZKOcgD]{[G2] Jilëa Narador}) cares for this tomb in her off hours.</p>\n<p>The next three crypts are ossuaries for common-born Laranians. Each of the crypts dates from a specific time, so that the bones of those that died in the Civil War lie in the first, those who succumbed to the Red Death in the next. The third is the newest and is slowly being filled with the bones of the dead. As space is always an issue in these public ossuaries, the practice is to save the skull of the deceased, carefully marked with a number. The Obasaran maintains the registry of the dead, noting in which ossuary or crypt each individual is interred.</p>\n<p>The next two monuments belong to the large yeomen clans of the hundred, the Urdels and the Arandin. These are plain stone buildings, their dour façades relieved only by the family name.</p>\n<p>Beyond the final gate is a large, plain stone cube. Only a small, low opening at the end of the path interrupts its unmarked surface. This edifice is the temple’s ossuary.

{"name":"Lethyl","pages":[{"name":"Adventure Hooks","type":"text","text":{"content":"<h1>Help, the bride is missing!</h1>\n<p>The PCs are attending the wedding at the abbey as part of the wedding party or as representatives of their liege, the Sheriff. The wedding is between the Arandin family, yeomen of the Kobarney clan, and the Andin clan, who control the salt trade in the hundred. There is a palpable tension in the air. The Arandin want the cash of the bride price. The Andin want the dower land and the prospect of becoming a landholding clan. There is, however, no chance that the warriors will ever settle in and be friendly with their new stall-keeping in-laws.</p>\n<p>It is midmorning of the wedding day. The wedding procession lines up but, when the time comes, there is no bride to walk down the aisle. Both sides are quick to point fingers and shout accusations. The PCs, as the closest thing to impartial third parties, are either asked to intervene by the Serolan or step forward on their own accord. A quick search of the area reveals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bride was staying in the inn with her bridesmaids but was missing when they came back from arranging her bath in the abbey bake house. This was just after dawn but the disappearance was not reported while her family searched for her.</li>\n<li>None of the horses is missing from the abbey or the inn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the indignation and accusations die down a bit, someone starts to organize the hue and cry. It is then that the Valaran discovers that two ashesa (see @UUID[JournalEntry.W2ZsqvVGz3YSwp7m.JournalEntryPage.2skrhhacueTut4tI]{[B8] Dormitory - Acolytes} and @UUID[JournalEntry.bdtDRmVGQsY135ma.JournalEntryPage.4AEaz19AwYnBmtQp]{[I8] Male Acolytes' Dormitory}) are also missing.</p>\n<p>Brian Kleve (@UUID[JournalEntry.HchCZQEzexQyQGBq.JournalEntryPage.uV6EOWctayZEYT0o]{[11] Cottar (Beadle) Brian Kleve}) saw an ashesa going into the cemetery just after dawn. This was not unusual, so he didn’t think anything of it. A few moments later, two other acolytes entered the graveyard. He can lead searchers to the crypt he saw them visit. The crypt shows signs that one of the markers has been disturbed. The size of the space behind the small slab of marble shows the limit of how much could have been hidden there.</p>\n<p>The escapees have a few hours’ head start. Did the ashesa run off with the bride? Which way have the gone?</p>\n<h2>The Truth</h2>\n<p>Lindina Aradin had cold feet. She was never enthralled with the prospect of marriage, so when her escort's attention was elsewhere for a moment, she fled. She disguised herself with a white cloak and ran from the inn to the graveyard. Jumping the back wall, she went east through the fields until she was clear of the village and then turned south. She avoided the road and Denwald, staying in the fields and woods until she reached the river. Another few hours of walking got her to her uncle in Hakstyn before nightfall. She is a bit of a tomboy, so the daylong cross-country trip was easy for her. Her tracks through the fields are easy to see by any skilled tracker but, because she is staying away from the main roads, she hopes to avoid pursuit.</p>\n<p>The two ashesa planned their escape for months. Kardis (@UUID[JournalEntry.bdtDRmVGQsY135ma.JournalEntryPage.4AEaz19AwYnBmtQp]{[I8] Male Acolytes' Dormitory}) hid food, tools, and clothes in the Baradis crypt. He and Terelyn [B8] planned to escape during the wedding service and have a good head start toward Getha before their absence was discovered. They joined the traveling throng on the Silver Way and worked their way south to Chybisa. Once they got to Burzyn, Terelyn wrote her uncle again and waited for a reply until their scarce resources ran out. Desperate, they found work with another merchant caravan bound for Thay.</p>\n<h3>How does it end?</h3>\n<p>Unless someone helps the runaways escape, this story does not have a happy ending. Lindina's uncle was sympathetic but knew the law. Since the wedding contract was legally signed, he had no choice but to return her to her father. Terelyn's story was more tragic. Kardis was caught trying to steal food and flogged as a thief in Harden. His wounds became infected and he died. Terelyn, alone in Thay and without money, became a prostitute to feed herself. She has thought about rejoining the Church, if they will take her back.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"_id":"bDvbwTxyA7hFejTK","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":-6250,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Credits","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>This module is made possible by the hard work of HârnWorld fans, and is provided at no cost.

The wedding itself has become more elaborate over the years. Old sagas write of royal households marrying their children with little more than the couple standing and offering a toast at dinner. Now, as with many things, ritual and formality crept into the process, as well as the actual ceremony itself.</p>\n<p>There are three distinct phases to a wedding: the contract, the banns, and the wedding day.</p>\n<h2>The Wedding Contract</h2>\n<p>The contract is not a religious document but it is often witnessed by the Church to give the agreement added weight. The parents or clans of the bride and groom arrange the vast majority of noble marriages. The considerations in making the union have more to do with political and financial matters than with love.</p>\n<p>The wedding contract is a legal document. The parents or guardians of both bride and groom must sign and it must be countersigned by at least three witnesses. It is not uncommon for liege lords to require that they be allowed to witness their vassals’ wedding contracts. This document specifies three important items: the amount and form of the bride’s dowry, the same for the bride price, and the date and place of the wedding ceremony. Once the contract is signed, the couple is considered to be betrothed to each other.</p>\n<p>The bride’s dowry is the property that a woman brings to her husband at the time of the marriage. This property is usually made in land or grant of income from a commercial concern. The family of the bride gives the dowry as a marriage gift. The husband is compelled to return the dowry in case of divorce or the death of the wife if still childless. One purpose of the dowry is to provide support for the wife on the husband's death, as the groom’s own property may return to the clan.</p>\n<p>The bride price is the converse of the dowry, as it the amount of money or property given by the groom to the bride’s family for the right to marry her. The bride price is transferred permanently to the bride’s family and is traditionally intended to compensate the bride’s clan for lady’s absence.</p>\n<p>The date and place of the wedding are also set in the contract. The orchestration of the wedding service is the duty of the groom’s family, as are the gifts for the servants and church staff.</p>\n<h2>Reading the Banns</h2>\n<p>The banns of marriage, or simply \"the banns,\" are the public announcement that a marriage is going to take place in that temple between two specified persons at a specified time.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the banns is to allow time for anyone to raise any legal impediment to the wedding and prevent marriages that are legally invalid, either under canon or civil law. Such an impediment might be a prior marriage (or pre- contract or betrothal, those being legally the same as a marriage), a vow of celibacy, the couple's being related too closely, or lack of consent.</p>\n<p>In Kaldor, the reading of the banns is necessary for the validity of a marriage. By decree of King Haldan I, the banns must be read aloud from the altar of the wedding’s temple over a period of three Soratirs prior to the actual wedding ceremony. Omission of this formality renders the marriage void. Because of this law, elopers must leave Kaldor, usually for Chybisa, in order to contract a marriage without these formalities. In fact, these “southern” marriages are often the source for prolonged legal disputes.</p>\n<h2>The Wedding Day</h2>\n<p>The wedding actually begins the day before the wedding ceremony. Both bride and groom arrive with their families and attendants. By tradition, the bride’s family sequesters her in either a pavilion or a room in a local inn. The bridal party keeps guard to ensure that she cannot be kidnapped or despoiled. The groom, meanwhile, is escorted to the temple where he is supposed to meditate and pray. He is left alone with his groomsmen, although many suspicious fathers-in-law have been known to place their own guard on the groom’s chambers – to ensure his attendance at the ceremony if nothing else.</p>\n<p>Because family members arranged marriages, the newlyweds are very rarely allowed to see one another before the service. Many bridal couples meet for the first time at the wedding service. Their families, intent on exchanging the dowry, are afraid that the groom might refuse to marry the bride if he does not like her countenance.</p>\n<p>On the morning of the wedding, both bride and groom are escorted to separate bath chambers. Their attendants bathe them in hot water and sweet smelling oils before dressing them in their wedding clothes. Wedding clothes are basically more elaborate versions of contemporary clothing. While there is no special clothing, most couples arrive at the altar displaying their family’s wealth in the form of intricate embroidery, beading, expensive fabrics, and dyes. Red (for loyalty and duty) and green (for fertility) are favored colors for both brides and grooms.</p>\n<p>After they have been dressed, the priest leads the bridal party into the temple. The famous chronicler, Verena Goldenhair, described it thusly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The bride...was led to church between two sweet boys with lace and rosemary tied about their silken sleeves. There was a fair bride cup of silver carried before her, wherein was a goodly branch of rosemary, gilded very fair, hung about with silken ribbons of all colors. Musicians came next, then a group of maidens, some bearing great bride-cakes, others garlands of wheat finely gilded, and thus they passed into the church; and then arrived the bridegroom finely appareled, with the young men followed close behind.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The actual wedding ceremony is as simple as its prelude is complicated. The couple kneels in front of the altar while the priest delivers an abbreviated form of Soratir. The homily in this occasion deals with the couple’s duty to each other, to their families, and to Larani. Finishing the sermon, the priest drapes the couple’s wrists with a red band, symbolizing their tie together in the goddess’ eyes. The bride and groom exchange rings, stand, and proclaim their union to the assemblage by raising their hands and saying, “We are one!” in unison.</p>\n<p>The newlyweds then lead the wedding parties from the temple. Verena’s narrative indicates that the event’s solemnity relaxed considerably at this point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The ceremony ended in a riotous manner. Young men tore ribbons, garters, and lace from the bride as souvenirs. Later, the crowd raucously escorted the bridal couple to their bedchambers.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the newlywed couple is sequestered in the wedding chamber, usually in the abbey’s guesthouse, the rest of the attendees enjoy a boisterous wedding banquet to celebrate the new union. The groom’s clan, who use the setting to display their wealth and prestige, hosts this formal meal.</p>\n<p>The event begins with a communal prayer for the bride and groom’s future wealth, health, and fertility. From that point, the decorum of the diners becomes notably less obvious. Loud songs and off color humor are tolerated by both sides but, as the mead flows and the jibes sharpen, it is not uncommon for fists to fly and knives to be drawn before the next dawn.</p>","format":1},"_id":"btDxlZ3d48TS2x0F","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":-9375,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Settlement Overview","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p><strong>Location:</strong> Fethael Hundred, Kaldor<br /><strong>Status: </strong>Abbey of the Order of the Spear of Shattered Sorrow<br /><strong>Government: </strong>Serolan Valric Belgine<br /><strong>Liege:</strong> Rekela of Brynd<br /><strong>Population:</strong> Village 132; Abbey 23</p>\n<p>Lethyl is a prosperous, if slightly rustic, Laranian abbey bordered by the dark Kirsta Forest on the northern border of Fethael Hundred. It is about two and a half leagues west of the town of Getha and the Silver Way.</p>\n<p>Dedicated to Saint Syrele, this out of the way abbey draws a small but steady stream of pilgrims. As the only Laranian abbey in Fethael Hundred, the local nobility visit the abbey for regular religious services and festivals. The two manors that have chaplains, Getha and Hyzevel, receive their priests from the abbey. These priests serve short periods (3-5 years) at the manors before returning to the abbey and being replaced.</p>\n<p>The hundred’s nobility often conclude festivals by bestowing gifts on the abbey. These celebrations allow the nobles to mingle in a neutral setting and the Serolan is often called upon to mediate or witness legal agreements made during these holidays.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>There has been an abbey at Lethyl since 186. It was in that year that Wyliam of Lethyl, a veteran of the Battle of Noneth, found himself dying without family. His wife and two sons had been taken by a plague, so he petitioned the king for permission to leave his manor to the Church. King Medrik I, then still king of Serelind, agreed and the abbey was founded on Saint Ambrathas’ feast day.</p>\n<p>The abbey’s small temple was dedicated to the King’s father, Calsten of Serelind. One of Medrik’s commanders, Sir Ebryn Kobarney (q.v. Hyzevel and @UUID[JournalEntry.Tln9sfujpNZrxUTK.JournalEntryPage.LvuXmWPtXkfpok9F]{[F2] The Infirmary}), later endowed a small infirmary on the abbey’s grounds for veterans of the Migration Wars and their family members.</p>\n<p>The little abbey has survived a number of assaults during Kaldor’s turbulent history. None has succeeded in breaching the cloister walls but the village has been rebuilt a number of times. The temple’s finest moment was when King Medrik I, at that time ruler of Kaldor, visited to attend a service at the abbey’s temple.</p>\n<p>The little abbey has survived a number of assaults during Kaldor’s turbulent history. None has succeeded in breaching the cloister walls but the village has been rebuilt a number of times. The temple’s finest moment was when King Medrik I, at that time ruler of Kaldor, visited to attend a service at the abbey’s temple.</p>\n<p>The abbey wallowed in rustic obscurity for several centuries, eclipsed by the raising of cathedrals in Brynd and Caleme. In the mid-sixth century TR, the relics of Saint Syrele were brought to the abbey. The Serolan, seeking to restore his abbey to a more important place in the Church, commissioned a new temple to house the relics.</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p>The Serolan, called Reverend Father by his charges, is lord of the abbey and its attached manor and liege-lord over Denwald, Jenkald, and Hakstyn. The Reverend Father Valric is an aloof figure. He rules with an iron hand, often acting more like a secular lord than a man of the cloth, dispensing low justice in his role as lord of the manor. The common knowledge is that heads roll when Reverend Father Valric sits in judgment.</p>\n<p>The abbey is organized along the usual Laranian structure. Advising the Serolan are the four masters who sit on the Council of Five. Each master has specific responsibilities and a staff of matakea (priests) to assist them. The matakea are called Father or Mother. The abbey has a few lay members, called Brother or Sister, but they are seldom seen outside the cloister.</p>\n<p>While the Serolan is nominally in charge of the Lady of Paladins’ chapter houses at Jenkald and Hakstyn, the Rekela of Brynd has allowed the knights direct access to him and fostered a degree of independence from the abbey in them. This “minor insubordination” rankles the Serolan. The matter has increased in importance due to the recent raid on the abbey. Reverend Father Valric is preparing a journey to Brynd and plans to lay the blame for the abbey’s losses at the feet of the Lady of Paladins.</p>\n<p>The Serolan does, however, successfully wield his authority over the manor of Denwald. Sir Udet Tardally plays the faithful vassal well but, in his quest to increase his privy purse, is constantly inventing ways to pad his accounts. For his part, the Serolan expects a certain amount of petty subterfuge from his vassals and is willing to overlook a few minor transgressions, as long as Sir Udet remains loyal.</p>\n<p>Master Tonin (@UUID[JournalEntry.EFyzRsHMwhCLkLEM.JournalEntryPage.2blx8dFSuZi6b91B]{[K4] Obasaran (Secular Representative)}) is the Obasaran (Master of Secular Affairs) and represents the Serolan in discussions with Lethyl’s reeve and the village craftsmen. The abbey owes one knight and three yeomen to the Rekela’s war band during the muster. Master Aetral (@UUID[JournalEntry.EFyzRsHMwhCLkLEM.JournalEntryPage.nRXlEBLxRNQ8DPVO]{[K1] Menoran (Master of the Fighting Order)}) and three of the village’s freemen serve in this capacity.</p>\n<h2>Economics</h2>\n<p>The village prospers from providing goods and services to the visiting nobility and pilgrims. Surplus goods are taken to Getha to be sold. Items can be ordered from Varybis the Peddler (see Getha and FHG) and are delivered on market day.</p>\n<p>The manor itself is only 1,730 acres but has been well managed and is fertile (LQ 1.12). The fields and orchards are east of the abbey, while the pastures are north of the Sezaze Road. The mill is on the southern edge of the village and uses a millrace from the Fethryn River to power its wheel. The Dancing Trout Inn accommodates visiting nobility when the abbey’s small guesthouse is full and serves a fine menu of local foods and beverages. Trout from the river, as might be expected, is the inn’s specialty.</p>\n<p>The manor holds its market in the dirt square in front of the inn on the morning of every Third- Day. Vendors purchase a market pass from the innkeeper, Juris Haral (@UUID[JournalEntry.HchCZQEzexQyQGBq.JournalEntryPage.kH7aWWkleAW4wnTy]{[15] The Dancing Trout Inn}), to set up a stall. Juris collects the hawking tax from the vendors for the Obasaran. The market is small and only lasts the morning hours but most household necessities can be found for purchase.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>The abbey and the worship of Larani dominate the religious climate of Lethyl. All of the hundred’s noble families are Laranians. Many of the nobles attend Soratir each ten-day in addition to the holidays. Laranian lay services are held in the chapel of Saint Syrele.</p>\n<p>An Ebasethe, Wyliam of Ewen, travels from Sezaze to hold Peonian rites in the small shrine that the villagers have built in the wood (@UUID[JournalEntry.HchCZQEzexQyQGBq.JournalEntryPage.2jUSsX2XtwOwvtL8]{[33] Peonian Shrine}). He visits the village at least twice a ten-day.</p>\n<p>The Serolan aggressively discourages the “lewd behavior” of the Haleans, so the craftsmen journey to Getha to celebrate the Golden Handmaiden’s holidays. Other religions are not tolerated. Worship of Agrik, Morgath or Naveh is punishable by death.</p>\n<h2>Saint Syrele (??-438)</h2>\n<p>The abbey’s patron saint was a Laranian missionary amongst the Taelda in the early fifth century TR. Saint Syrele was a dark haired, blue- eyed woman who rejected marriage and chose to lead her squire Tokra and a faithful servant Gerin into the wilderness. She spent many years preaching to the heathens in the Sorkin Mountains. A gifted orator and tactician, she helped the Taelda defeat the encroaching gargûn.</p>\n<p>Hearing of her successes, a Taelda chieftain asked for her help in ridding his clan’s lands of a demon. Thinking that she would be facing another nest of gargûn, she agreed and set off on the quest. As she climbed into the lower passes of the Sorkin, she came across signs of a gigantic beast. Surveying the torn ground and trampled brush, the noble born Syrele remembered the lessons of her youth and chose a stout spear before proceeding.</p>\n<p>Gripping the spear tightly, she moved forward into a wall of reeking mist and thorny weeds, alone but unafraid. She reached a small opening and found herself faced with a giant, smoke breathing boar. A hellish light flared in its eyes as it charged. Syrele set her spear and stood fast. The beast’s tusks tore her hip on its first pass. Syrele spun to receive the next assault but the demon- boar had disappeared into the wall of mist. She heard Gerin’s scream and realized that the beast was attacking her followers.</p>\n<p>Syrele ran back into the clearing. Gerin was on the ground screaming in pain. Tokra was dead, killed while trying to save his wounded compatriot. Syrele charged. She slashed the boar’s hindquarters with her spear and drew it away from her injured servant. She circled the boar, putting herself between the demon and the wounded men.</p>\n<p>Weak from her wound, Syrele slumped to her knees. The demon stopped, pawing the ground as it sized up its prey. Syrele did not bow her head in prayer or submit meekly to martyrdom. Instead, she screamed her defiance. Vowing that she would roast his haunches over the flames of his demon lord, Syrele struggled to her feet and leveled her spear. Gerin later swore that a cloak of pearly white descended on his mistress’ shoulders in those next few heartbeats. Syrele screamed Larani’s name as a war cry and buried her spear in the boar’s chest.</p>\n<p>The demon drove itself upon Syrele’s spear point even as it died. With its last breath, the beast drove its tusks into Syrele’s heart. Gerin testified before the Serekela that he saw a woman, dressed in white samite, descend from the heavens and lift his mistress into her arms.</p>\n<p>“My mistress returned to me in the night,” his testimony records. “She guided me from that unholy place and kept me safe from the devils that abided there.”</p>\n<p>Many years later, Gerin joined the priesthood and told his mistress’ tale far and wide. When others received her aid after invoking Syrele’s name, Gerin’s fame grew. In time, Syrele became a patroness of hunters and those that stood alone against incredible odds. She was sainted in the latter part of the fifth century and became popular in the eastern part of Hârn, especially in the regions of the Sorkin and the Neph highlands.</p>\n<p>In 536, Serolan Iberry Kabise commissioned a study of the saint’s miracles. Satisfied of her blessed state, the Serolan had a “rescue expedition” of knights and priests retrieve the saint’s bones from the Sorkin Mountains. On their return, Reverend Father Iberry proclaimed that a new temple would be built to honor the Saint. It fell to his successor, Brun Saleris, to ensure that the temple was worthy of the saint’s relics and consecrate the New Cloister in 549.</p>\n<h2>Current Events</h2>\n<p>Not a month ago, the snows of winter were melting from the forest floor. Lethyl was a quiet village that ran smoothly in accordance with a regimented religious calendar. This calm was shattered at dawn on the last day of Morgat.</p>\n<p>Mounted raiders emerged from the forests east of the village while the peasants were walking to their labors in the fields. The raiders’ heavy swords cut down innocent men that had never raised a weapon in their lives. The attackers tore down the Sezaze Road but were unable to breach the abbey’s gate before the priests rallied and drove the raiders away. Three raiders were buried in an unmarked grave north of the abbey. Four farmers lost their lives that morning and the rest of the villagers lost their sense of security. No one knows what prompted such a bold attack and a sense of unease has settled over the little village.</p>\n<p>This situation has brought to light many petty spats in the village. The Kleves are anxious to retain the positions of power that they have earned over the last 15 generations of service to the abbey. At the same time, Reverend Father Valric is using the situation to secure warriors and additional support from the Lady of Paladins’ chapter houses in Hakstyn and Jenkald.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"_id":"UAaLV7HGtpaSGNyY","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":-25000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Visiting Lethyl Abbey","type":"text","text":{"content":"<h2>Soratir</h2>\n<p>The Soratir, or low mass, is open to the laity. It is held on the fifth, fifteenth and twenty-fifth of each month. The Serolan usually leads the ceremony, although any master can officiate. Because most of the nobles in the hundred travel to the abbey on the day of the mass, services begin at the hour before noon and conclude early in the afternoon to allow for the return journey to be completed in the light of day.</p>\n<p>Soratir begins with a procession of the faithful. Ashesa lead the double file of clergy, carrying censers of smoking incense and bearing banners of red and white. Following the ashesa, march the choir chanting one of the Songs of Alamire, the precise hymn being linked to the month of the year. The matakea follow behind in order of seniority, the most junior priests in front. Finally, the temple’s masters enter four abreast in front of the Serolan. The clergy file directly to their seats but remain standing while the congregation finds their places and settles. At the Serolan’s signal the choir begins the Hymn of Ambrathas, the traditional beginning of the Soratir. Everyone lends his or her voice to the hymn, remaining standing until the song is completed and the Serolan indicates that they may sit.</p>\n<p>After greeting the congregation, the celebrant reads from the Book of Valamin before delivering a sermon. The sermon is usually a homily on a specific virtue that consists of an example from the life of a saint or legendary hero. These sermons are intended to show that chivalry and sacrifice are the paths to honor for those who are just and pious. The sermon is followed by another hymn before the clergy form ranks for the concluding procession. After the service, the congregation socializes in the courtyard or at the village inn. Invited guests are escorted to the Serolan’s tower for luncheon.</p>\n<h2>Tirannon</h2>\n<p>The Tirannon is a special form of the worship service. This ceremony is dedicated to Saint Ambrathas, as it marks the transition of a squire into the knighthood. A Tirannon is a lengthy ceremony and is specially arranged by the squire’s sponsor and the Serolan.</p>\n<p>The ceremony begins on the evening of the first day with a special mass. The readings and hymns of the service are from the Tome of Shields and are meant to focus the candidate’s mind on the duties and responsibilities of chivalry. After the mass, the candidate is bathed and dressed in pure white, to symbolize his purity.</p>\n<p>An honor guard of armed ashesa leads the candidate into the altar of Saint Ambrathas in the temple of Saint Syrele. The candidate’s mother or wife stands on the right of the altar (the candidate’s left) holding his shield. She holds up the candidate’s shield, enjoins him to become a protector of the weak, and then lays the shield on the altar. In the center, the Serolan holds the belt and spurs of a knight. He cautions the candidate about the sins of pride and reminds him of the vow of service that he is about to take. The candidate’s father or sponsor stands on the left of the altar holding the candidate’s sword in front of him. He speaks about courage and family honor before laying the sword across the altar. The three celebrants turn and leave the candidate to his vigil. The candidate must remain awake in front of the altar for the entire night, fasting and praying for Larani’s blessing.</p>\n<p>At dawn of the second day, the celebrants return to the chapel. The Serolan leads a mass in front of an audience of family and friends, which includes the clan head and feudal lord. The Serolan attaches the candidate’s spurs and fastens the wide sword belt around his waist. After blessing has been said, the candidate’s parents give him his shield and sword.</p>\n<p>Now that he is officially a knight, the candidate’s sponsors present him to his feudal lord. He kneels and swears homage with his sword. Once the ceremony is completed, the new knight leads the procession from the chapel.</p>\n<p>The completion of a Tirannon is the cause of celebration, the extent of which is limited only by the purse of the knight’s family. Gifts of weapons, armor, and horses are bestowed upon the new knight. The wealthier families also grant the young man property or a position as a bailiff, if possible, to help secure his future.</p>\n<h2>Alamirata</h2>\n<p>One other form of service is conducted at the Abbey. The Alamirata is the Laranian high mass and is restricted to the clergy. It is always held in the temple of Calsten and is led only by the Serolan. The chapter members stand in two parallel lines, facing the altar in order of seniority throughout the service.</p>\n<h2>Saint Syrele’s Day</h2>\n<p>The Serolan hosts the feast of Saint Syrele at the abbey on 10 Savor after celebrating a special Soratir. Guests that must travel a distance usually arrive the night before but, given the size of the Hundred, most attendees travel to the abbey in the morning. The Serolan leads the Soratir’s procession to the statue in the apse of the Chapel [A2]. Accompanied by chanting, he is followed by matakea carrying swords and swinging censors of sweet smelling incense. At the statue, the four temple masters lift the bier that supports the reliquary and place it front of the temple’s main altar at the beginning of the service. The Soratir is heard at mid-morning and lasts until mid- afternoon. At the end of the service, it is customary for the Baron and three selected noblemen to lift the reliquary’s bier and return the saint to her place of rest.</p>\n<p>After the service has ended, there is an hour or so for socializing and refreshing while the monks set the tables for the feast. The meal lasts several hours, with each of the five courses being served separately. Few guests stay the night and the woods twinkle with the torchlight as the nobility of the hundred rides home through the spring night. This feast traditionally marks the beginning of the Baron’s annual hunting week and is well attended by the Indama clan and other nobility of the Shire.</p>\n<h2>Relics, Saints, and Pilgrims</h2>\n<p>The mortal remains of Saint Syrele are held in a reliquary in the saint’s chapel. The reliquary is a rectangular (2’ x 2’ x 3’) cedar chest covered with gold and amber bas-relief that illustrates the Saint defeating the demon. Inside the lead lined chamber are the saint’s bones, wrapped in a cocoon of the finest linen. Most of her bones are in the reliquary but gifts of the saint’s relics have been made to distinguished people in the past. Saint Syrele’s head, for example, was sent to the Serekela for interment in Caleme and a finger bone was given to the Baron of Getha for his chapel’s altar.</p>\n<p>Pilgrims pray in the presence of the reliquary in the belief that the Saint’s presence will help grant their prayers. Many pilgrims come offering thanks for the Saint’s assistance in times of trouble. It is common, for example, for warriors or hunters who survive devastating wounds to make a pilgrimage to Lethyl to thank the Saint for saving their lives.</p>\n<p>Visitors are allowed into the presence of the saint for three hours after the noon bell every day. During the public visitation times, an honor guard of two ashesa protects the reliquary, preventing damage or souvenir gathering by the occasional over-enthusiastic pilgrim. A small donation box at the apse stairs gently reminds visitors to make a concrete expression of their faith before leaving the abbey. As the pilgrims leave the abbey’s cloister, Hirila the smith’s wife (@UUID[JournalEntry.HchCZQEzexQyQGBq.JournalEntryPage.UdLV1biRg90Aw2QO]{[14] Metalsmith Mathil Berma}) offers to sell them small metal badges displaying the boar of Saint Syrele, a souvenir of their pilgrimage to venerate the blessed saint.</p>\n<p>The abbey also houses relics of the sainted King Calsten and of many locally revered saints. Admission to the Chapel of Calsten, where these items are kept, is rare and must be arranged with the Serolan personally.</p>","format":1},"_id":"nGuo2ixC5omlNCn1","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":-12500,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Overview","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>Lethyl is a \"Location Module\"; it is designed to depict the Lethyl Abbey and village located in Fethael Hundred, Nephshire, kingdom of Kaldor, on the island of Hârn in the <a href=\"https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/\">HârnWorld fantasy setting</a>; however, this abbey and village could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.</p>\n<p>This module is based on the \"<a href=\"https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/settlements/lethyl/\">Lethyl</a>\" fanon; please see @UUID[JournalEntry.eoSIuQXymUfnqNR4.JournalEntryPage.bIYgD8kuzx8Jhzi5]{Credits} for more information.</p>\n<p>This module details all of the households, including interior plans of the abbey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using this module with Non-HârnMaster systems</h2>\n<p>This entire module is system-agnostic.  See the section below on NPCs for details about the residents; these details may be used to generate appropriate statistics for your game system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using the Scenes</h2>\n<p>A number of scenes are provided representing maps. These scenes depict both internal and external areas; internal areas are generally set at a 5-foot grid spacing, while exterior areas use much larger scaling. The following subsections describe some common elements of these scenes.</p>\n<h3>Map Notes</h3>\n<p>The scenes make extensive use of Map Notes to provide detailed description of important areas in the scenes. To view these map notes, click on the \"bookmark icon\" in the canvas toolbar. Map notes are not visible to players, only to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Text and Markings</h3>\n<p>In various areas text and or markings have been provided in the scenes to assist the GM. Generally this information is set to only be visible to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Stairs</h3>\n<p>Some stairs may have an arrow indicating the direction the stairs descend. When present these arrows are visible to all players.</p>\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n<p>To control ambient lighting, use the \"darkness\" setting for the scene.</p>\n<p>All scenes have been setup with Unrestricted Vision Range enabled, with a Vision Limitation Threshold set to 0.7. This allows all areas of the scene to be lit during the day, but vision is limited and lights are required at night.</p>\n<p>Internal lamps and candle lights have been placed in indoor areas. These lights have been set to enable when the \"darkness\" setting is ≥ 0.2, that is, just after things start becoming dim.</p>\n<p>Hârn has a cool climate, so all fireplaces and braziers are constantly lit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Recommended Modules</h2>\n<p>The following modules, although not required, are highly recommended to enhance this module:</p>\n<p><strong>Compendium Folders: </strong>Due to the large number of journal entries in this module, these journal entries have been organized into sub-folders using Compendium Folders. If Compendium Folders is not used, these will all show up as a single long list of Journal Entries in the compendium. As long as you follow the links starting with the Overview journal entry, it should not be necessary to navigate the compendium, but if you want to navigate through the Journal Entries yourself, having Compendium Folders will greately simplify this task.</p>\n<p><strong>Backgroundless Pins:</strong> The map note icons all have a dark grey background; with this module, that background disappears. This may increase your enjoyment of the maps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Background Information</h2>\n<p>For historical, political, and recent events, see
