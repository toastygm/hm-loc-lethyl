        "content": "<p>The Serolan is Reverend Father Valric Belgine. A member of minor nobility in Semethshire, he joined the church when his brothers showed no sign of either dying at a young age or sharing the family’s small holding of Barwal. He is a dogged but uninspired man. Having labored in the shadows of other men for over 20 years, he was made the Serolan of Lethyl at age 39. Now at 56, he rules the little temple with an iron fist. He has proclaimed that he will stay “at the head of Lethyl’s table until they pry my staff from my cold, dead, fingers.”</p>\n<p>In the past he has tried to exert some control over the martial chapters that are supposed to be under his control but the Rekela of Brynd, Verda Emerel, has thwarted him at every step. Valric is quietly waiting for the Rekela to die and then plans to make sure that the Reblena in “his hundred” understand their place. While the Reverend Father is in favor of the split between the Kaldoric and Melderyni branches of the Order of the Lady of Paladins, he fears that the martial order will use the schism to increase its already considerable political power.</p>\n<p>Valric Belgine is a tall, thin man who carries himself as the secular lord that he has always wanted to be. He is always dressed in the formal robes of the Serolan. Despite the fact that he is required to send one third of the abbey’s profits to the Rekela, he manages to live in comfort. He lives in the old manor tower, where he takes most of his meals. He has dinner on tenth-night with the temple’s masters and presides over a chapter meeting after every Soratir. When he is not playing the role of prince of the church, he can be found hunting with hound and hawk in the company of Sir Taryn Indama, the Bailiff of Sezaze, or Sir Udet Tardally, the lord of Denwald.</p>",
