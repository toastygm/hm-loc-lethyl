Paths of beaten earth crisscross the Peonian section of the graveyard.</p>\n<p>A wide gravel path leads from the first gate to a second. Inside the second enclosure are the stone mausoleums of the region’s Laranian clans. A visitor walking along the left side path would pass several family memorials. While the larger landowning clans prefer to inter their members at their home manors, many older noble families and all of the yeomanry choose to memorialize their relatives at the Abbey.</p>\n<p>The first mausoleum along the path belongs to the Baralis clan. Wild thorny roses have over grown the old crypt and none but the bees visit here. The names on the walls stretch back to 560TR. Everything looks dusty and neglected but a close inspection of the far left corner will reveal that one of the old markers has been moved (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bdtDRmVGQsY135ma.JournalEntryPage.4AEaz19AwYnBmtQp]{[I8] Male Acolytes' Dormitory}).</p>\n<p>Next, the eagle of the Rynsel clan stands over the doorway of a tall, white burial monument. A weathered marble cenotaph to Saint Freden, the man who held the right of the Serelindian battle line at Noneth, guards the entryway. Its fading carving reminds visitors of the family’s ancient and honorable heritage. A local Laranian saint, St. Freden’s remains lay elsewhere but many pilgrims leave flowers on the memorial to celebrate his memory. The location of St. Freden’s final resting place is one of the questions that Loran the Southron seeks to answer (see @UUID[JournalEntry.lsIPZJR96Q5NKjQN.JournalEntryPage.9KGrhPzZn8nJvQ1e]{[J1] Reading Room}).</p>\n<p>Third in line, this monument once belonged to the Lournay clan but, on their assumption of the lordship of Drilen, was sold to the ancient but impoverished Narador family. The Naradors labor as mercenaries and household knights throughout eastern Hârn. Regardless of where they have lived and fought, the family takes great pride in burying the hearts of their family members here in the family tomb. Jilëa Narador (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bnBWlFJBTpHrgk89.JournalEntryPage.jIN5lCIPcBZKOcgD]{[G2] Jilëa Narador}) cares for this tomb in her off hours.</p>\n<p>The next three crypts are ossuaries for common-born Laranians. Each of the crypts dates from a specific time, so that the bones of those that died in the Civil War lie in the first, those who succumbed to the Red Death in the next. The third is the newest and is slowly being filled with the bones of the dead. As space is always an issue in these public ossuaries, the practice is to save the skull of the deceased, carefully marked with a number. The Obasaran maintains the registry of the dead, noting in which ossuary or crypt each individual is interred.</p>\n<p>The next two monuments belong to the large yeomen clans of the hundred, the Urdels and the Arandin. These are plain stone buildings, their dour façades relieved only by the family name.</p>\n<p>Beyond the final gate is a large, plain stone cube. Only a small, low opening at the end of the path interrupts its unmarked surface. This edifice is the temple’s ossuary. Members of the temple find their final rest here.</p>",
