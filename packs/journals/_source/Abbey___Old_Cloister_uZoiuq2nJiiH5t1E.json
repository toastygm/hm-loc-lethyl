        "content": "<p>The old cloister’s temple is dedicated to Calsten, the first king of Serelind. The chapel’s walls are covered with frescoes in white and red, with a sword device to commemorate Calsten. There are three statues in the nave. The first (situated to the left of the altar) is of Sharin Lomar, the abbey’s first Serolan. He is depicted as a middle aged man carrying a model of the Temple of Calsten and a Serolan’s staff.</p>\n<p>The central statue is of King Calsten. He is shown in full armor with the crown of Serelind on his head. He holds a replica of his legendary sword aloft with one hand. In the other, he carries the horn with which he rallied his army in the battles fought to forge Serelind. This horn, which has been in the abbey’s possession for hundreds of years, is covered in runes. Too large to be from any Hârnic breed of cattle, the horn is reputed to have been made from a mystical beast that Calsten slew during one of his quests.</p>\n<p>The apse has an elaborate tapestry behind the statue of Calsten that tells the legend of his reign. Behind the tapestry, all 33 of the abbey’s former Serolans are entombed in the floor. Since this space is small, the bodies are buried vertically (“standing up”) under marble markers.</p>\n<p>The easternmost statue is of Serolan Iberry of Kabise. He led the expedition to find the remains of Saint Syrele and is depicted as an old man holding a model of the temple of Saint Syrele.</p>\n<p>This temple is used for the Alamirata, services that are restricted to the clergy. The Serolan always leads the service during the Alamirata. It has the same form as the Soratir but the sermons and readings deal with more theological matters.</p>",
